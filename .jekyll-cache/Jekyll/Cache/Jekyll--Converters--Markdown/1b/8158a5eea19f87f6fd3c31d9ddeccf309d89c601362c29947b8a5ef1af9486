I"<p><em>Dancer in the Loop</em> was an interactive installation by myself (Ben Dexter Cooley) and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/silence_castor/">Silence_Castor</a> (Nate Hicks) launched for Burlington’s <a href="https://highlight.community/">NYE Highlight festival</a>. It debuted at the Burlington City Arts gallery from 5-7pm.</p>

<p>The piece was part audiovisual installation, part performance. And it all depended on audience interaction.</p>

<p><em>Dancer in the Loop</em> was a multi-sensory show that combined dance, visual projection, and generative electronic music. Each of these 3 elements were connected through technology, feeding off of one another and changing the parameters.</p>

<p>Audience participants moved, swayed, danced, and vibed in front of a camera; this camera was connected to a laptop running Touchdesigner, which morphed and changed the visual projection behind the dancers. This data also changed the music in real time. Dancers will then improvise along with the generative music and visuals, creating a feedback loop of call and response between human and machines.</p>

<p>To keep things evolving, Nate and myself transitioned between 5 different “scenes” throughout the show, each with a different interaction pattern, projection style, and soundscape.</p>
