I"<p>lately i have been fascinated by the idea of sound journals.</p>

<p>i have been a haphazard paper journaler for the past 4 years. as with most things my consistency ebbs and flows. but i like the tactical nature of it. word journaling helps me to think, reflect, plan, archive, remember.</p>

<p>i think of a sound journal as the same, but for audio. as a musician i put a huge amount of thought and work into my official â€œreleasesâ€ (maybe too much thought). but there is so much music that i make, sounds that i explore, which never get published.</p>

<p>and thatâ€™s okâ€“not everything needs to â€œout thereâ€. but sometimes i want to go back to a sound, or a patch, that i was fiddling with a few weeks back. it can be hard to remember where to start. a sound journal helps to catalogue and mark the sonic territories that i was once exploring. a sort of sonic breadcrumb.</p>

<p>much like word journaling, it is also interesting to listen to who and where i was at a given time period. what sounds were influencing and inspiring me. over the past few months i have started to track and archive these snippets of sound.</p>

<p>you can listen to them on <a href="https://alonetone.com/saintsilva">AloneTone</a>, a website similar to soundcloud. but unlike soundcloud (acquired in 2017 by hedge fund), the code is open source and it is free to use. i settled on alonetone as a hosting solution because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>i fundamentally agree with <a href="https://alonetone.com/about">their model of software</a></li>
  <li>nothing can be sold</li>
  <li>you can add comments for each track, which i use as reminders to myself of where i was, what instruments i used, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>â€œsound journalingâ€ is still a loose concept and i am still gathering examples of what i mean here. but here are a few that inspired me, and that i think fall into this general family:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://danielklag.bandcamp.com/album/facsimile"><em>Facsimilie</em></a> by Daniel Klag â€“ â€œAn ode to portable literatureâ€¦recorded over the course of two years in small, intimate spacesâ€¦Facsimile is an audio diary for the digital age, composed on a laptop using portable instruments such as battery-powered synths and samplers interspersed with field recordings sourced from East Coast hiking trips spanning Acadia to Asheville.â€</li>
  <li><a href="https://yaraasmar.bandcamp.com/album/home-recordings-2018-2021"><em>Home Recordings 2018</em></a> - 2021 by Yara Asmar â€“ â€œwonderful debut album of music she recorded at home on cassettes and a mobile phone over the past few yearsâ€ via Hive Mind</li>
  <li><a href="https://lightbath.bandcamp.com/album/selected-public-works-vol-5"><em>Selected Public Works, Vol. 5</em></a> by Lightbath â€“ â€œEach piece an artifact of a time and a place Each piece an entry in a journal.â€</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="collections-as-formations">collections as formations</h2>

<p>sometimes these journal entires may go on to become a larger object.</p>

<p>last year i put out a collection of tracks which are in this â€œsound journalâ€ world called <a href="https://stsilva.bandcamp.com/album/formations-1-2"><em>FORMATIONS 1</em></a>. this collection sits in some liminal space between a jam and a traditional â€œsongâ€, and was largely inspired by <a href="https://steamroom.bandcamp.com/album/steamroom-49">Jim Oâ€™Rourkeâ€™s Steamroom recordings</a>. i hope to continue putting out these small collections.</p>

<p>in my head this sort of release is in between a â€œsound journalâ€ and an EP or LP. i am settling on the term â€œformationâ€ for this objectâ€”something concrete and self-sufficient, but not entirely finished or actualized. a vague outline, neither here nor there.</p>

<p>to use a literary example, in order of complexity:</p>

<p>journal entry â€“&gt; essay â€“&gt; book</p>

<p>might translate to:</p>

<p>sound entry â€“&gt; formation â€“&gt; album</p>

<p>reviewing my sound journal entries to find new â€œformationsâ€ has also been a rewarding creative process. i forget sounds that i once conjured, and this activitiy forces me to review what i did in the past.</p>

<p>if you know of any other sound journals email them to me at bendextermusic @ gmail dot com.</p>
