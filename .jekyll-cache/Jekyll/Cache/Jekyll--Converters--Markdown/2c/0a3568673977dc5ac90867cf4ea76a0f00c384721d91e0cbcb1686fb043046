I"[<p>Ethereal Bloom is a series highlighting ambient and experimental music at Spiral House Collective. This is an idea I have wanted to pursue for a long time, and Iâ€™m excited to get it off the ground.</p>

<p>My hope is that Ethereral Bloom can be a different kind of venue and series: a true listening experience, which welcomes both the attuned musician and the passive listener just wanting to chill out.</p>

<p>The shows feel like a cozy living room and include much more than just music. Ethereal Bloom features live projected visuals behind the musicians performing.</p>

<p>Movement at Ethereal Bloom is welcome, and so is lying on the floor. Drawing materials, poetry books, and hand fidgets will be provided. This is a space that welcomes folks who may feel overstimulated at typical gigs! Below are a few photos from the first Ethereal Bloom.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5B46f5OhBs/">next bloom</a> will be April 5.</p>
