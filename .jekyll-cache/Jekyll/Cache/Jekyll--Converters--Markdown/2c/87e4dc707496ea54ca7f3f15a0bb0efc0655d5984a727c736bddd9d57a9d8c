I"ª<p>I am trying to get better at treating this as a public notepad, and less like a ‚Äúwebsite‚Äù. To that end, here are some notes on upcoming shows and releases for this summer.</p>

<h3 id="loading-screen-music">Loading Screen Music</h3>

<p>On June 21 I‚Äôm releasing a collaborative album with my friend Ian Steinberg, a.k.a. Coppermind. I‚Äôll write more about it closer to release day, but if you‚Äôre a fan of minimal piano ambient music then you should check it out. If you listen on Spotify, you can <a href="https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/coppermindandstsilva/loading-screen-music?utm_campaign=website&amp;utm_medium=Email+&amp;utm_source=SendGrid">pre-save it here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="summer-shows">Summer shows</h3>

<p>My next performance will be at <a href="https://st-silva.netlify.app//2024-03-28-about-ethereal-bloom/">Ethereal Bloom</a>, the recurring ambient / experimental music series I host at Spiral House Collective. Ian and I will be playing through <em>Loading Screen Music</em> almost in its entirety as a little album release show. We will also be joined by the incredible harpist <a href="https://mariehamiltonmusic.com/">Marie Hamilton</a> and ambient guitar wizard <a href="https://www.tompearo.com/">Tom Pearo</a>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve also got a performance on July 14 at Burlington City Arts, which I can‚Äôt share much about yet, but will post more details soon.</p>

<h3 id="sound-installation">Sound installation</h3>

<p>I am working on my first sound installation piece for an interactive exhibit at The Phoenix in Waterbury, VT. And I am highly jazzed about it. The exhibit will be a community created collage, for which I am designing an audio-reactive musical system which will take shape as the collage mural takes shape over the course of two days. Will do a little write-up on how it all works once I figure that out.</p>

<p>The sound installation will culminate with a performance consisting of me reacting and responding to the musical system on July 13 at 7pm.</p>
