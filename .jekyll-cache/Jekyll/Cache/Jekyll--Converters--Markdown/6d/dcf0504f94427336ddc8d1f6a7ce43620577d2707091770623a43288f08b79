I"°<p>Introducing <em>Saint Silva</em>, a new ambient musical project with a first EP.</p>

<!-- start main content -->

<p><img src="../assets/tiny-cover.jpeg" alt="Tiny album cover" /></p>

<p>Today I released my first EP under the moniker <em><a href="https://stsilva.bandcamp.com/releases">St. Silva</a></em>, exclusively <a href="https://stsilva.bandcamp.com/releases">here on Bandcamp</a> (all proceeds go to IEN). I have been thinking about this project for a few months now, and finally got a chance to put some weight behind it. This is the first time I am actually writing about <em>why</em> I wanted to start this in the first place.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs an inherent risk in starting new musical projects; they feel exciting at first, but quickly fizzle out and die. At the moment I am juggling 3-4 different musical projects, all with different types of styles/sounds, and all at various levels of ‚Äúreadiness‚Äù to share with the world. <em>Saint Silva</em> is my way of granting permission, to myself, to experiment freely with the ideas I am currently most enamored by.</p>

<h2 id="like-oxygen">Like oxygen</h2>

<p>A few months ago, a friend introduced me to the more private work of Jim O‚ÄôRourke through his <a href="https://steamroom.bandcamp.com/music"><em>Steamroom</em></a> sessions. Since then I keep thinking about something he said in <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jim-orourke-steamroom-40/">an interview</a>‚Äîwhen asked about the motivation behind these mini-releases, his reply was ‚ÄúI just have to make them‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like my oxygen.‚Äù</p>

<p>This felt familiar and also entirely new. I am usually writing, intentionally or subconsciously, some kind of music, because I think at some level I need to. But when it comes time to do a (drumroll) <em>release</em>, my momentum crumbles.</p>

<p>I wanted to find ways of circumventing this cycle. So I turned to using a few creative constraints.</p>

<h2 id="some-rules-for-tiny-and-beyond">Some rules for <em>Tiny</em> and beyond</h2>

<p>This album was composed during a weekend away at a tiny house in New Hampshire. The tracks include various field recordings from inside and outside of the house. Most tracks, by design, use only one or two analog synthesizers, and a piano.</p>

<p>Each song is meant to capture a place in time, removed from the world, temporarily.</p>

<p>I mixed and mastered the tracks in about two days. One of the rules I am setting for myself with <em>Saint Silva</em> is to release the music <strong>while I‚Äôm still excited about it</strong>. This is a vague measuring stick, but to not follow this rule introduces what I‚Äôve come to think of as a ‚Äúcycle of supression‚Äù.</p>

<p>The cycle goes like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I write a song, and I am very excited about it</li>
  <li>I start recording the song, and I am still excited</li>
  <li>I dive into the technicalities of recording in my DAW like choosing plug-ins, adding reverb, automating mix parameters, etc.</li>
  <li>Then, feeling exhausted I take a break‚Ä¶and it sits, on my laptop, for weeks. Other life happens. I am always thinking about it, and it is always mocking me. I feel it can be better, somehow; I just need to figure out how to improve it.</li>
  <li>Slowly, I fall out of love with the song I first started and it never sees the light of day.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hate that. I hate thinking there are unfinished ideas that I am simply too precious to ever put out there. As Ray Bradbury wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúSelf-consciousness is the enemy of all art, be it acting, writing, painting, or living itself, which is the greatest art of all.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an attempt to suppress my self-consciousness, my rule for this work is to publish while I‚Äôm still excited. This is a tricky balance beam to walk; not all work is meant to be shared with the world. Editing is an essential step. Bradbury also said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúAll arts, big and small, are the elimination of waste motion in favor of the concise declaration.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, to walk the fine line then. But it‚Äôs a challenge I‚Äôd like to embrace.</p>

<p>I am always fascinated to raed about the processes other artists use to create their work. I want to make that a priority with <em>Saint Silva</em> as well. So here are some notes on the influences and building blocks that led to this piece of music.</p>

<h2 id="music-for-airports-forests">Music for <del>airports</del> forests</h2>

<p>Although I have been writing music most of my life, I only recently began to actively put out new music again under <em><a href="https://bdexter.bandcamp.com/music">B. Dexter</a></em>. This music is often deeply personal, lyrical, and structured in a more-or-less mainstream friendly format. But lately I have become enveloped in the worlds of experimental and ambient music, which don‚Äôt seem to fit as well into the process of how I usually write songs.</p>

<p>After a few months of reading up on the work of Brian Eno, Steve Reich, Harold Budd (etc etc.) I decided to create a musical playground of sorts. I bought a few analog synths and started thinking about how to incorporate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies">oblique strategies</a> into the songwriting and music-making process.</p>

<p>I quickly became obsessed with Eno‚Äôs landmark <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_1:_Music_for_Airports">Music for Airports</a> album, especially after reading <a href="https://reverbmachine.com/blog/deconstructing-brian-eno-music-for-airports/">this article</a> which dissects how Eno constructed the various tape loops to create the work in 1978.</p>

<p>The idea of music as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture_music">‚Äúfurniture music‚Äù</a>, or background music that complements a certain time and place, has been around for a century. It was first used in 1917 by French composer Erik Satie. Using this concept, I started wondering what music for different environments might sound like; what sitting by a pond sounds like, or hiking through the woods, or standing in the rain.</p>

<p>I find this crossroads of electronic music and nature to be fascinating, partly due to the apparent dichotomy between the two: electrical circuits generating sound against the backdrop of soft crickets and forest noise. This is the space I want to explore.</p>

<h2 id="environmental-music">Environmental music</h2>

<p>Of course there is an obvious nod here to the genre of environmental music (sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúJapanese Ambient Music‚Äù due to the pioneering artists in the space from Japan). I have been greatly influenced here by the work of Hiroshi Yoshimura‚Äôs <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jx7CyMZVhHY">GREEN</a></em> and Shiho Yabuki‚Äôs <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=shiho+yabuki">New Meditation</a></em>.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs something whimsical and searching about these songs that I can‚Äôt put my finger on yet. But it was the first time I started seriously thinking about using field recordings in music as an ambient backdrop.</p>

<p>The contrast of natural noises to the ‚Äúartificial‚Äù synthesizers (although electrical currents are no less natural, per se) creates a kind of marriage between the wild and the domesticated.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks I‚Äôll be exploring more ideas for <em>Saint Silva</em>. If you‚Äôd like to follow along, <a href="https://saintsilva.bandcamp.com/releases">follow me on Bandcamp</a> or <a href="https://bdexter.com/">subscribe to my email newsletter updates</a> or you can. I‚Äôll probably post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/b_dexter_">Instagram</a> too, albeit reluctantly.</p>
