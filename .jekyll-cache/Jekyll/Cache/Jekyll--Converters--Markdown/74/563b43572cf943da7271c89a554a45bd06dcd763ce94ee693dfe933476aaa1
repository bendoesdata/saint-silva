<p>Today I’m happy to release a new split single with my friend Duncan Geere: <a href="https://camembertelectrique.bandcamp.com/album/the-carrington-event"><em>The Carrington Event</em></a>, out now via French label <a href="https://camembertelectrique.bandcamp.com/music">Camembert Électrique</a>.</p>

<p>These two songs represent two different interpretations (one by me, one by Duncan) of the greatest solar storm in recorded history. We used a process called data sonification to convert the data into musical parameters. I won’t go into the full details here, because Duncan and I did a full write-up about our process on the <a href="https://www.loudnumbers.net/carringtonevent">Loud Numbers website</a>.</p>
