<p>Today I released a new piece of music <em>Formations 1</em>. Itâ€™s an idea Iâ€™ve been turning over for a while now â€” what becomes of all the music that doesnâ€™t seem to â€œfitâ€ anywhere? What happens to the happy accidents?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>formations: an act of giving form or shape to something or of taking form, development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Formations</em> is a collection of recordings captured in my home studio sometime in late 2023 / early 2024. It sits in some liminal space between â€œjamsâ€ and a full release. Iâ€™ve been thinking about this space for some time now. With music, thereâ€™s so much pressure built up around album releases, EP launches, surprise single drops. <em>Formations</em> is a practice in finding a middle ground.</p>

<p>I try to play music, even if itâ€™s just moving knobs, every day. And sometimes I stumble upon an idea that feels interesting enough to hit record. These recordings are often short, just enough time to capture a sonic snapshot of the moment.</p>

<p>The other day I was going through old recordings, searching for parts for an album Iâ€™m working on. I have a clear vision for this upcoming album, and established parts that will form the backbone. But some recordings felt totally foreignâ€”I have no memory of how I created those sounds and Iâ€™m not sure if I could accurately recreate them now. They feel like ghosts of something, a snapshot in time.</p>

<p>As I listened to my archive I was reminded of Jim Oâ€™Rourkeâ€™s <a href="https://steamroom.bandcamp.com/">Steamroom recordings</a> and it brought me to this quote from an <a href="https://insheepsclothinghifi.com/jim-orourke-steamroom-recordings/">old interview</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I donâ€™t think I get an ounce of enjoyment from doing this whatsoever. Anybody who tells you they do is insane. But Iâ€™m trying to counteract my tendency to hide all that stuff. So occasionally Iâ€™ll find a tape after years of forgetting it even existed, and if Iâ€™m surprised by it â€” like, â€˜Oh, that isnâ€™t complete crapâ€™ â€” then Iâ€™ll post itâ€¦I just have to make them. Itâ€™s like my oxygen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Formations</em> is in this same spirit. I have to make them, I naturally make them all the time. Small elements, modules of sound. Some parts will grow and mature into part of a song. But others wonâ€™t. Itâ€™s enough that they exist. And as I gear up for tracking a new album, which will be more of a traditional release, this felt like a good way to â€œcounteract my tendency to hideâ€.</p>

<p>Adding â€œ1â€ to the album title indicates my hope that this will be the start of a series of releases. Each time I catalog my recordings (every couple months, sometimes longer) Iâ€™ll try to release a new <em>Formations</em> of all the pieces that moved me somehow.</p>

<h2 id="production-notes">Production notes</h2>

<p>All pieces on <em>Formations 1</em> were recorded in a single take off of a 4 channel mixer. This eliminates the possibility of much post-production or editing. I added some effects to a few tracks and did some light mastering, but thatâ€™s it.</p>

<p>The instruments used on <em>Formations 1</em> are hard to categorize, since it could be any number of synths in my studio, some of which I no longer own. A few incorporate generative sequencing scripts using a Monome Norns Shield.</p>
