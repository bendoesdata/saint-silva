I"<p>On July 12-13, I had the opportunity to debut my first sound installation work as St. Silva.</p>

<p><em>Paralleling</em> was a community based art experience and installation at <a href="https://thephoenixvt.com/">The Phoenix Gallery</a>, guided by visual artist, by artist <a href="https://www.lindeneller.com/">Linden Eller</a>. It included multiple stations with different materials where participants can experience the reflective, meditative, and playful nature of mark making. As participants made series of hatch marks, Linden used these materials to assemble an intuitive, abstract installation in the gallery.</p>

<p>I was approached by Phoenix curator Joseph Pensak with the idea of providing some soundscapes for the event. After talking with Linden, I was immediately drawn to the evolving, unpredictable nature of the collage taking shape over two days. So I proposed that the music do the same.</p>

<p>The result was <em>Chromallel</em>, an interactive sound installation that watched and responded to the creation process taking place on the wall. The installation used</p>

  <li>when Linden entered the frame of the camera, the system would treat her as part of the piece. From one perspective, this is an error, and the system shouldn‚Äôt be latching onto the color of her dress. But while it happened, I decided not to intervene and correct the code here: the artist being ‚Äúin frame‚Äù is also inherently part of the exhibit. The visual of the artist standing in front of the wall, adding colors and shapes, is part of the experience. Sometimes if Linden was standing there long enough, the musical character of the soundscape would shift slightly, before eventually returning to a more ‚Äústable‚Äù state using only the colors and shapes on the mural wall.</li>
