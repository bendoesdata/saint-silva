<h2 id="about">about</h2>

<p>Ethereal Bloom is a series highlighting ambient and experimental music at Spiral House Collective in Burlington, VT.</p>

<p>My hope is that Ethereral Bloom can be a different kind of venue and series: a true listening experience, which welcomes both the attuned musician and the passive listener just wanting to chill out.</p>

<p>The shows feel like a cozy living room and include much more than just music. Ethereal Bloom features live projected visuals behind the musicians performing.</p>

<p>Movement at Ethereal Bloom is welcome, and so is lying on the floor. Drawing materials, poetry books, and hand fidgets will be provided. This is a space that welcomes folks who may feel overstimulated at typical gigs! You can find photos from the first Ethereal Bloom <a href="https://st-silva.netlify.app//2024-03-28-about-ethereal-bloom/">here</a> or view some of the shows on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4VtLvGuguq/?img_index=8">Instagram</a>.</p>
