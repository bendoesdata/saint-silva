Two years ago, I announced my first release under the moniker Saint Silva. It was a sound experiment, one that I thought would probably be a one-off release.

But recently I have become drawn back into the sounds I first started exploring in 2021. I have started constructing live performances of soundscapes that were previously only playable using a DAW.

And so I wanted to build a simple home for Saint Silva. This is a place to add liner notes on my releases and sound experiments. It's also a place to document previous shows and announce upcoming shows.
