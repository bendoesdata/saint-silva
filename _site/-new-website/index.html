        <p>Two years ago, I announced my first release under the moniker St. Silva. It was a sound experiment, one that I thought would probably be a one-off release.</p>
<p>But recently I have become drawn back into the sounds I first started exploring in 2021. I have started constructing live performances of soundscapes that were previously only playable using a DAW.</p>
<p>And so I wanted to build a simple home for St. Silva. This is a place to add liner notes on my releases and sound experiments. It's also a place to document previous shows and announce upcoming shows.</p>
