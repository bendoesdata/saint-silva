        <p>lately i have been fascinated by the idea of sound journals.</p>
<p>i have been a haphazard paper journaler for the past 4 years. as with most things my consistency ebbs and flows. but i like the tactical nature of it. word journaling helps me to think, reflect, plan, archive, remember.</p>
<p>i think of a sound journal as the same, but for audio. as a musician i put a huge amount of thought and work into my official &quot;releases&quot; (maybe too much thought). but there is so much music that i make, sounds that i explore, which never get published.</p>
<p>and that's ok--not everything needs to &quot;out there&quot;. but sometimes i want to go back to a sound, or a patch, that i was fiddling with a few weeks back. it can be hard to remember where to start. a sound journal helps to catalogue and mark the sonic territories that i was once exploring. a sort of sonic breadcrumb.</p>
<p>much like word journaling, it is also interesting to listen to who and where i was at a given time period. what sounds were influencing and inspiring me. over the past few months i have started to track and archive these snippets of sound.</p>
<p>you can listen to them on <a href="https://alonetone.com/saintsilva">AloneTone</a>, a website similar to soundcloud. but unlike soundcloud (acquired in 2017 by hedge fund), the code is open source and it is free to use. i settled on alonetone as a hosting solution because:</p>
<ul>
<li>i fundamentally agree with <a href="https://alonetone.com/about">their model of software</a></li>
<li>nothing can be sold</li>
<li>you can add comments for each track, which i use as reminders to myself of where i was, what instruments i used, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;sound journaling&quot; is still a loose concept and i am still gathering examples of what i mean here. but here are a few that inspired me, and that i think fall into this general family:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://danielklag.bandcamp.com/album/facsimile"><em>Facsimilie</em></a> by Daniel Klag -- &quot;An ode to portable literature...recorded over the course of two years in small, intimate spaces...Facsimile is an audio diary for the digital age, composed on a laptop using portable instruments such as battery-powered synths and samplers interspersed with field recordings sourced from East Coast hiking trips spanning Acadia to Asheville.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://yaraasmar.bandcamp.com/album/home-recordings-2018-2021"><em>Home Recordings 2018</em></a> - 2021 by Yara Asmar -- &quot;wonderful debut album of music she recorded at home on cassettes and a mobile phone over the past few years&quot; via Hive Mind</li>
<li><a href="https://lightbath.bandcamp.com/album/selected-public-works-vol-5"><em>Selected Public Works, Vol. 5</em></a> by Lightbath -- &quot;Each piece an artifact of a time and a place Each piece an entry in a journal.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>collections as formations</h2>
<p>sometimes these journal entires may go on to become a larger object.</p>
<p>last year i put out a collection of tracks which are in this &quot;sound journal&quot; world called <a href="https://stsilva.bandcamp.com/album/formations-1-2"><em>FORMATIONS 1</em></a>. this collection sits in some liminal space between a jam and a traditional &quot;song&quot;, and was largely inspired by <a href="https://steamroom.bandcamp.com/album/steamroom-49">Jim O'Rourke's Steamroom recordings</a>. i hope to continue putting out these small collections.</p>
<p>in my head this sort of release is in between a &quot;sound journal&quot; and an EP or LP. i am settling on the term &quot;formation&quot; for this objectâ€”something concrete and self-sufficient, but not entirely finished or actualized. a vague outline, neither here nor there.</p>
<p>to use a literary example, in order of complexity:</p>
<p>journal entry --&gt; essay --&gt; book</p>
<p>might translate to:</p>
<p>sound entry --&gt; formation --&gt; album</p>
<p>reviewing my sound journal entries to find new &quot;formations&quot; has also been a rewarding creative process. i forget sounds that i once conjured, and this activitiy forces me to review what i did in the past.</p>
<p>if you know of any other sound journals email them to me at bendextermusic @ gmail dot com.</p>
