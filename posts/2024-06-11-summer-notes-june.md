I am trying to get better at treating this as a public notepad, and less like a "website". To that end, here are some notes on upcoming shows and releases for this summer.

### Loading Screen Music

On June 21 I'm releasing a collaborative album with my friend Ian Steinberg, a.k.a. Coppermind. I'll write more about it closer to release day, but if you're a fan of minimal piano ambient music then you should check it out. If you listen on Spotify, you can [pre-save it here](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/coppermindandstsilva/loading-screen-music?utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=Email+&utm_source=SendGrid).

We also made a limited run of cassettes for the release. Will post a link to those when they are available for mail order too.

### Summer shows

My next performance will be at [Ethereal Bloom](https://st-silva.netlify.app//2024-03-28-about-ethereal-bloom/), the recurring ambient / experimental music series I host at Spiral House Collective. Ian and I will be playing through *Loading Screen Music* almost in its entirety as a little album release show. We will also be joined by the incredible harpist [Marie Hamilton](https://mariehamiltonmusic.com/) and ambient guitar wizard [Tom Pearo](https://www.tompearo.com/).

I've also got a performance on July 14 at Burlington City Arts, which I can't share much about yet, but will post more details soon.

### Sound installation

I am working on my first sound installation piece for an interactive exhibit at The Phoenix in Waterbury, VT. And I am highly jazzed about it. The exhibit will be a community created collage, for which I am designing an audio-reactive musical system which will take shape as the collage mural takes shape over the course of two days. Will do a little write-up on how it all works once I figure that out. 

The sound installation will culminate with a performance consisting of me reacting and responding to the musical system on July 13 at 7pm.
