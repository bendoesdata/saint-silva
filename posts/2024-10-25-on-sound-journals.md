lately i have been fascinated by the idea of sound journals. 

i have been a haphazard paper journaler for the past 4 years. as with most things my consistency ebbs and flows. but i like the tactical nature of it. word journaling helps me to think, reflect, plan, archive, remember.

i think of a sound journal as the same, but for audio. as a musician i put a huge amount of thought and work into my official "releases" (maybe too much thought). but there is so much music that i make, sounds that i explore, which never get published. 

and that's ok--not everything needs to "out there". but sometimes i want to go back to a sound, or a patch, that i was fiddling with a few weeks back. it can be hard to remember where to start. a sound journal helps to catalogue and mark the sonic territories that i was once exploring. a sort of sonic breadcrumb.

much like word journaling, it is also interesting to listen to who and where i was at a given time period. what sounds were influencing and inspiring me. over the past few months i have started to track and archive these snippets of sound.

you can listen to them on [AloneTone](https://alonetone.com/saintsilva), a website similar to soundcloud. but unlike soundcloud (acquired in 2017 by hedge fund), the code is open source and it is free to use. i settled on alonetone as a hosting solution because:
- i fundamentally agree with [their model of software](https://alonetone.com/about)
- nothing can be sold
- you can add comments for each track, which i use as reminders to myself of where i was, what instruments i used, etc.

"sound journaling" is still a loose concept and i am still gathering examples of what i mean here. but here are a few that inspired me, and that i think fall into this general family:
- [*Facsimilie*](https://danielklag.bandcamp.com/album/facsimile) by Daniel Klag -- "An ode to portable literature...recorded over the course of two years in small, intimate spaces...Facsimile is an audio diary for the digital age, composed on a laptop using portable instruments such as battery-powered synths and samplers interspersed with field recordings sourced from East Coast hiking trips spanning Acadia to Asheville."
- [*Home Recordings 2018*](https://yaraasmar.bandcamp.com/album/home-recordings-2018-2021) - 2021 by Yara Asmar -- "wonderful debut album of music she recorded at home on cassettes and a mobile phone over the past few years" via Hive Mind
- [*Selected Public Works, Vol. 5*](https://lightbath.bandcamp.com/album/selected-public-works-vol-5) by Lightbath -- "Each piece an artifact of a time and a place Each piece an entry in a journal."

## collections as formations

sometimes these journal entires may go on to become a larger object.

last year i put out a collection of tracks which are in this "sound journal" world called [*FORMATIONS 1*](https://stsilva.bandcamp.com/album/formations-1-2). this collection sits in some liminal space between a jam and a traditional "song", and was largely inspired by [Jim O'Rourke's Steamroom recordings](https://steamroom.bandcamp.com/album/steamroom-49). i hope to continue putting out these small collections.

 in my head this sort of release is in between a "sound journal" and an EP or LP. i am settling on the term "formation" for this objectâ€”something concrete and self-sufficient, but not entirely finished or actualized. a vague outline, neither here nor there.

to use a literary example, in order of complexity:

journal entry --> essay --> book

might translate to:

sound entry --> formation --> album

reviewing my sound journal entries to find new "formations" has also been a rewarding creative process. i forget sounds that i once conjured, and this activitiy forces me to review what i did in the past.

if you know of any other sound journals email them to me at bendextermusic @ gmail dot com.
