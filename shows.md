Improvisational performance responding to an artist lecture at the closing reception of [The Phoenix Art gallery](https://thephoenixvt.com/events-calendar/2023/8/11/phoenix-talks-steve-budington-amp-saint-silva). Event description:

*“Phoenix Talks,” a free ongoing series of short talks about art, music, books and culture kicks off in style with a talk from one of the artists in our current ART IS CANDY exhibit, Steve Budington. Steve is the associate professor of painting at the University of Vermont and quite the prolific painter, musician and master gardener (there must be something Steve can’t do but we haven’t found it yet). Steve’s talk will be followed by an improvisational musical performance by the electronic artist Saint Silva, responding to the theme of the talk, “Call Shore.”*
